		<p>PCPC PRAYER GUIDE INTRODUCTION </p>
		<p>This guide has a simple aim: to help us grow in our love for God through time in His Word and prayer. The Bible teaches that in order to love God, we need a relationship with Him. That relationship has been provided by God Himself, through overcoming the alienation caused by our sin through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God the Son. In union with Christ, we now have intimate access to God as our heavenly Father. Scripture and prayer are the means through which we experience, apply, and enjoy that relationship. As we learn to pray and as we learn to listen and obey the gracious overtures of God’s Word, we learn to live as God’s children—to love and trust Him more fully.  </p>
		<p>WHY DAILY PRAYER?</p>
		<p><span>Why</span><span> set aside fixed times every day for prayer? Why not simply pray unprompted, when the stirring comes? Practically speaking, we are creatures attuned to rhythms. We order our lives by sunrises and sunsets, by hours, weeks, seasons, and years. Daily prayer is a way of consecrating our ordinary rhythms to God, ensuring that all of life is offered to Him. C. S. Lewis once wrote, “Relying on God has to begin all over again every day as if nothing had yet been done.” And so it must. Our relationship with God should take hold of our schedules as well as our hearts.   </span></p>
		<p><span>Historically, this has been the way of God’s people. Consider the testimonies of the psalmists: </span></p>
		<p>“Blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord, &#9;&#9;&#9;and on His law he meditates day and night.”<span> (Psalm 1:1-2)</span></p>
		<p>“Evening and morning and at noon I cry out to you…”<span> (Psalm 55:17)</span></p>
		<p>“Seven times a day do I praise you…”<span> (Psalm 119:64)</span></p>
		<p><span>By the time of the first century, the ritual of daily prayer was formally embedded in Jewish spirituality. There were several hours in the day that marked regular times for prayer. The first detailed miracle in Acts happened because Peter and John were going to the temple “at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour” (Acts 3:1) for three o’clock prayers. Peter’s vision in Acts 10 confirming God’s grace for the Gentiles occurred as he was observing sixth-hour prayer, his noon devotions (Acts 10:9). The community that gathered after Pentecost devoted themselves daily to “the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers” (Acts 2:42).</span></p>
		<p>The practice of daily prayer continued through the early church, and expanded consistently throughout time and culture wherever the gospel spread. Along with Sunday worship and the sacraments, daily prayer remains a central way that Christians all over the world express devotion to Christ.   </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>But, we might simply hearken back to Jesus himself. Jesus set aside times to pray regularly, even as the eternal Son of God. He celebrated His dependence on the Father (John 5:19, 30) and sought sanctuary in solitude with Him (Luke 5:16). If it was necessary for Jesus to pray, who is “very God of very God,” how much more for us, who are made to bear His image.</p>
		<p>WHY A PRAYER GUIDE?   </p>
		<p>A common objection to using a liturgy for devotions is that it restricts freedom, deteriorating into heartless formality.  However, if you’ve ever found yourself repeating the same words and phrases over and over again in prayer “spontaneously,” then you know that our own minds and experiences are just as restrictive. Guided prayer is not meant to curb freedom but to bolster it, by introducing into our prayer life the language and imagery of the Scriptures. </p>
		<p>  </p>
		<p>Here are a few compelling reasons to use a prayer guide: </p>
		<p>1. &#9;It helps us to pray regularly. </p>
		<p>Many people do not pray regularly because they do not know where to begin. A prayer guide takes the pressure off needing to make that decision anew every day. It repeatedly says, “Start here.”  You do not need a stirring, a reason, a plan, or consistency. Simply, “start here,” and let God’s Word lead you into prayer.        </p>
		<p>2. &#9;It helps us to pray biblically. </p>
		<p><span>In this prayer guide, there is no commentary from gifted Christian authors or pastors. It is uncluttered, so to speak. The elements come either directly from Scripture or from common worship. The majority of time is spent in the Psalms, a book of the Bible meant especially for prayer and worship. One of the encouraging messages reiterated in the Psalms is that you do not have to put on a happy face to live the Christian life. Praying biblically allows us to pray the truth of who we are while growing in the hope of who we might yet become.     </span></p>
		<p>3. &#9;It helps us to pray communally.      </p>
		<p>Though we are praying individually, we are doing so together, specifically as a church body. This book is meant for this flock, in this time and place. To know that others with whom God has joined us are reading and praying the same words encourages us in our common journey. Prayer is a communal work as much as an individual one.  </p>
		<p>HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE? </p>
		<p>Use this guide however it is helpful to you. For many, that means using it just as it is; for others who are already committed to daily reading plans or Bible studies, that may mean skipping the Scripture readings and only using some of the other portions; for those who are in the habit of family worship, you can adapt the guide to read and pray together as a family.</p>
		<p>Here are suggestions for each of the elements:  </p>
		<p>The Call to Worship </p>
		<p><span>The Call to Worship is God initiating with you through His Word. Read the call, perhaps out loud. Receive God’s invitation to worship Him as spoken to you in that moment.   </span></p>
		<p>The Prayers of Praise and Thanksgiving </p>
		<p>Praise God for who He is as He has shown in His Word and in your life. Thank Him for His presence and gifts in your life.   </p>
		<p>The Readings </p>
		<p>The Psalm(s) follow the readings from the Book of Common Prayer, which covers all the Psalms every 30 days. Get to know the words here and you will better know Jesus Himself. There is no book of the Bible Jesus quoted more often than the Psalms.</p>
		<p>The other daily readings for this season follow in the tradition of the “Jesse Tree.” The name comes from David’s father, Jesse, and the prophecy in the Book of Isaiah that speaks of the coming Messiah:</p>
		<p>“A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.  The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him...” (Isaiah 11:1-2)</p>
		<p>These readings touch on the scope of God’s saving work, from Genesis through the birth of Jesus Christ. Since the traditional Jesse Tree readings begin just after Thanksgiving, there are a few passages that predate our prayer guide readings, which begin on Sunday, December 3. I encourage you to fit these in somewhere as time allows.     </p>
		<p>November 27: Isaiah 11:1-2</p>
		<p>November 28: Habakkuk 2:1-4</p>
		<p>November 29: Genesis 1:26-31</p>
		<p>November 30: Genesis 3:1-9</p>
		<p>December 1: Genesis 6:1-9:13</p>
		<p>December 2: Genesis 12:1-7</p>
		<p>After Christmas Day, our readings continue in a similar sweeping pattern. We cover key passages in the New Testament that address the ongoing significance of Jesus entering our world. The goal this season is to expand our appreciation for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, proclaimed to us through all of Christian Scripture, from Genesis through Revelation.</p>
		<p>The Prayers for the Day and Prayers for the Night </p>
		<p>In the morning, begin by saying The Lord’s Prayer, the model for prayer that Jesus taught His disciples. If you do not know it, you can find the words in the Appendix in this guide. Each phrase of the Lord’s Prayer is filled with grace and challenge. Say the prayer expectantly for the day ahead.  </p>
		<p>Prayers of Supplication and Intercession are opportunities for you to lay out before God whatever burdens you carry, as well as the burdens carried by others. Ask Him for things. Ask Him for mercy.  Ask Him to help you become more like Christ.  </p>
		<p>The Closing Prayer is a way to conclude. All of the closing prayers draw from the Book of Common Prayer and are unique to either morning or evening. They are called “collects” because they gather our prayers together and present them before God collectively as we go about our scattered lives.  Pray this prayer as your own, in the confidence that others are praying with you.  </p>
		<p>The Confession of Sin </p>
		<p>The Confession of Sin occurs at night, as we review our day. It is an opportunity to repent for the ways we have missed the mark and to receive the grace we need for renewal and change. In the Appendix, you will find a longer explanation for the process of self-examination that fits here.  </p>
		<p>The Words of Assurance </p>
		<p>The Words of Assurance are God’s promise to forgive, cleanse, accept, and renew you in Christ.  Hold onto these as you would anything of great value. Return to them when doubts or disillusionment grow.</p>
		<p>The Grace </p>
		<p>The Grace is God’s blessing on you as you go out into your day or lay your head down to sleep. Receive it as a final word until you return to pray again.  </p>
		<p>Sundays</p>
		<p>Sundays are unique as it is our time to gather and worship as a church family—to celebrate once again the victory of Christ over sin and death. There are only Psalm readings on Sunday because the liturgy of corporate worship is our primary focus. Consider using the Sunday morning liturgy again at night for personal prayer.  </p>
		<p>As a final word, there are many great reading plans, devotionals, and exercises to encourage in us a life of prayer. This is a way to pray, only one among many that has grown up in the history of God’s people.  Most important is not the method, but the reality of loving and trusting God. May your relationship with Him grow.    </p>

		<p>Heavenly Father, You know well that I have not always obeyed You and displayed the fruit of my salvation. I have not humbled myself in the face of my weakness.

		<p>Father in heaven, though I take Your name on my lips, my heart is often far from You.  When I say, “yes,” I don’t mean “yes,” and when I say “no,” I don’t mean “no.” I like to think well of myself, but find that my heart is laced with self-protection, malice, and deceit. O Lord, for the sake of Your name, do not remember me according to my sins, but according to Your great love. Amen. </p>

		<p>and lead me in the way everlasting! (Psalm 139:23-24) </p>
